Un - A Lightweight Data Structure Library for JavaScript

Un is similar to jQuery. Like jQuery Un uses a simple symbol to create its fundamental object. In Un's case this is _, an underscore.

Un wraps all of JavaScripts basic types

_([])
_({})
_('')
_(//)
_(0)

and adds another, kind of

_(_)

is equivalent to _(function(){}) and was chosen for simplicity, and the fact that a function of a function says a lot about functions.

To use Un just include un.js, alternatively each of the basic types is represented in a file

unray.js
unhsh.js
unstr.js
unrgx.js
unnmb.js
unfnn.js

and can be included as needed.
